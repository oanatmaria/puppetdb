  "Pg_restore and timeshift entries utility
   This command-line tool restores an empty database from a backup file (pg_dump generated file), then updates all the
   timestamps inside the database.
   It does this by calculating the period between the newest timestamp inside the file and the provided date.
   Then, every timestamp is shifted with that period.
   It accepts two parameters:
    - [Mandatory] -d / --dumpfile
      Path to the dumpfile that will be used to restore the database.
    - [Optional]-t / --shift-to-time
      Timestamp to which all timestamps from the dumpfile will be shifted after the restore.
      If it's not provided, the system's current timestamp will be used.
    !!! All timestamps are converted to a Zero timezone format. e.g timestamps like: 2015-03-26T10:58:51+10:00
    will become 2015-03-26T11:58:51Z !!!"
